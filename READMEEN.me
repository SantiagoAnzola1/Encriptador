## :page_with_curl: Description:
<p>This project was carried out as part of a challenge proposed by the Oracle HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT course.</p>



During this challenge, an application was developed that encrypts texts, and it also has a responsive web design for any screen size.

:key: The encryption "keys" used were as follows:

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

```javascript
For example:
"gato" => "gaitober"
"gaitober" => "gato"
```

## :scroll: Requirements:
- [x] It should only work with lowercase letters.
- [x] No accented letters or special characters should be used.
- [x] It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and also convert an encrypted word back to its original version.
